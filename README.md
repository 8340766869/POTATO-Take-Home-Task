# POTATO-Take-Home-Task
This repository contains a Python-based system for analyzing tweets about Britney Spears using two TSV files. 
The system allows users to ingest tweet data, perform queries, and extract insightful metrics.
## Project Structure
The project is divided into four parts:
### Part 1: Data Ingestion
Ingest the data from the provided TSV files into a structure that allows for efficient querying.
### Part 2: Query Functionality
Implement functionality to query the dataset. For a given search term, the system should return:
- The number of tweets containing the term for each day.
- The number of unique users who tweeted with the term.
- The average likes received by tweets containing the term.
- The locations (place IDs) from which the tweets originated.
- The times of day when the tweets were posted.
- The user who posted the most tweets containing the term.
